# HELP-Cluster
HELP International has raised approximately $10 million. 
Today, NGO CEOs need to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. 
So, the CEO must make the decision to choose the country that needs the most help. 
Therefore, the task is to categorize countries using several socioeconomic and health factors that determine the development of the country as a whole. 
Then you need to suggest which countries the CEO needs to focus on the most.

Case:
From several countries, I need to cluster them based on several features.
